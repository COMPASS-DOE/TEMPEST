# README.md

This folder contains metadata files from the tree GHG flux measurement campaigns.

2024 data were downloaded from Google Drive on 2025-10-25,
some correction made (see https://github.com/COMPASS-DOE/TEMPEST/issues/141),
concatenated into a single CSV file, and `dead_band` and `obs_length`
columns added.

`tree_flux_metadata21-25.csv` is Evan Phillips's metadata sheet, i.e. the 
year-round measurements made _not_ during flood treatments.
